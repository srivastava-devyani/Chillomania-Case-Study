# Chillomania Case Study

One of the case study I worked on during my Marketing Analytics Course at WBS Coding School was for Chillomania, a fictitious Germany based furniture startup planning to go online. 
We needed to create a strategy which includes:

1. Customer Journey Map for 2 personas namely Jennifer and Olaf
2. Online Marketing Presence Plan
3. Martech Stack
